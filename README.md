# iOS101-Project

Some ideas to improve the project: 
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Iplement a way to change the color of the text as well

Favorite Aps:
Instagram
- Clean UI, lets users focus on Content
- Minimally visually Invasive business model, they do take a lot of data behind the scenes, but visually you can't tell

SnapChat
- Nice UI -  you can tell there was a theme
- Nicely integrated Map feature, fun to use

BeReal
- Clean UI
- Nice App Concept - hooks users once a day

App Ideas:
An app where you could post a five second clip of your day, with a song overlay, and at the end of the year you can watch a highlight reel of your year
Some features:
- Maybe you could look up songs that have a certain lyric
- Spotify/Apple Music Integration?
- Month/Week Reels?
